My about info:
Hi and a very warm welcome to my GitHub Account! 
My name is Lavania Elizabeth Naidoo, but I go just by my first name.
I am a current student from @CodeSpace Academy, where I am completing their course on Software Development.
This is the home and main page of all my projects and challenges throughout my CodeSpace course.
They are there for your perusal and any suggestions will be helpful!
