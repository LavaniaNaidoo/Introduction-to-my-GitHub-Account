# Introduction-to-my-GitHub-Account

## About my GitHub Profile:

## Hi and a very warm welcome to my GitHub Account! 

- My full name is Lavania Elizabeth Naidoo, but I go just Lava or Lavania :-)

- I am a recent graduate from @CodeSpace Academy, where I completed their course on Software Development.

- This is the reference page of all my projects and challenges throughout my CodeSpace journey.

- If you'd like to see my projects, they are the main ones that are "starred" and pinned on my profile.

- And if you'd like to see a demo of my projects, they are the links listed below the Github ones. The demo links redirect you to another site where you can view them.

- They are there for your perusal and any suggestions will be helpful!
